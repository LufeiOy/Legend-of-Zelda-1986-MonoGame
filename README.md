# Level 1 of Legend of Zelda 1986 version
<br />

This is a project to reproduce level 1 of Legend of Zelda 1986 into PC.

We used the MonoGame template on the visual studio to implement this project.

This project is completed in Summer 2020 by me and my four teammates.

Our team created the same functions, User Interface, AI, map, items,etc as the 1986 version, and we added nightmare mode(hard mode) into the game.
